Abstract:

For a developing city, effective road traffic management is critical. In recent years, the Intelligent
Transportation System (ITS) has emerged as a critical field of research for addressing a variety
of traffic issues and assisting smart cities with technological solutions. Because roads link
people, the need of road safety is emphasized at all times. In order to properly manage traffic
congestion on highways, technologies must be able to precisely estimate traffic. This project
contains a survey of road data and traffic forecast for the roadways of Bengaluru, India, in order
to build an innovative technology strategy to anticipate road traffic flow in terms of congestion
levels using regression analysis.
Tom Tom Bengaluru Traffic Index provided the data for regression analysis. To forecast future
traffic flow, we used a variety of regression models, including polynomial regression, multiple
linear regression, random forest, and multilayer perceptron. Finally, an ensemble model is given
that estimates the congestion level using the bagging and boosting techniques. This approach
compares the results with multiple regression models using historical data and utilizes
ensembling to forecast the average congestion level to anticipate short-term traffic flows. The
examination of this data reveals that ensemble mode projections for distinct routes in Bengaluru,
India, tend to approach closer to the real congestion level.
Finally, this model is hosted on a cloud platform so that it is available as an open-source website.
Users can make well-informed decisions before commencing their road travel by interacting with
this user-friendly website. The website provides us with information on the expected congestion
levels of the roads in the near future.
